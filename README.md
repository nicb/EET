# Extended Ear Training exercises

An android app to develop an advanced Ear

## Technology

I plan to use `jruby` and the `ruboto` gem to develop this. I am a total
beginner with this stuff, so any suggestion about it is more than welcome.

## Status

The development on this app hasn't even started.

## Exercises

The (planned) exercises are the following

* *PFET* (**Prime Form Ear Training**): exercises to hear the individual color
  of prime forms. Created comparing equal-cardinality prime forms with
  different ordinals (first two-sets, then three, etc.)
* *NET* (**Noise Ear Training**): exercises to hear different forms of
  statistical distribution (uniform white, pink, blue, gaussian, poisson,
  etc.), with adjustable noise burst width (shorter => more difficult)
* *SET* (**Spectral Ear Training**): exercises to head different spectral
  constructions taken from spectralist music composition techniques (for ex.
  every 101 harmonics from 500-1000 harmonic with very low freq fundamental,
  etc.)

## Contributors welcome

I have zero time allocated to develop this app - I just have the idea of what
it should look and sound like. So any contributor is more than welcome:
